Linux is my main OS and I have encountered a few headaches setting up my development environment.</p><p><figure><a href=/blog/unity-on-linux/images/screenshot1.png><picture><source media=(min-width:600px) srcset=/blog/unity-on-linux/images/screenshot1_hu619e9f0c4f3c023168ce1da2abfa47c2_765933_1200x0_resize_q70_linear_3.png><source media=(min-width:1200px) srcset=/blog/unity-on-linux/images/screenshot1_hu619e9f0c4f3c023168ce1da2abfa47c2_765933_1800x0_resize_q70_linear_3.png><img class=md__image src=/blog/unity-on-linux/images/screenshot1_hu619e9f0c4f3c023168ce1da2abfa47c2_765933_600x0_resize_q70_linear_3.png alt="My Unity/Rider Setup"></picture></a><figcaption><small><i>My Unity/Rider Setup</i></small></figcaption></figure></p><p>To be able to write scripts in Unity you need to use an <a href=https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingSettingUp.html>external code editor</a>. Of course if you don&rsquo;t care about auto-completion and debugging you can use any editor, but that&rsquo;s not a realistic use case.</p><p>The officially supported IDEs are:</p><ul><li>Visual Studio</li><li>Visual Studio Code</li><li>JetBrains Rider</li></ul><h1 id=visual-studio>Visual Studio</h1><p>If you are on Windows the no-brainier solution is Visual Studio. However on Linux it is not available.</p><h1 id=visual-studio-code>Visual Studio Code</h1><p>My first choice was VS Code since it is free to use. However, at the time of writing (Q1 2023), it is hard to setup and can&rsquo;t be used for debugging.</p><p>To use VS Code you need to install the C# extension and a supported C# compiler to enable auto-completion. The current LTS version of Unity (LTS 2021) uses .NET Standard 2.0 and generates <code>.csproj</code> files targeting .NET Framework <code>4.7.1</code>. That means you cannot use the official Microsoft .NET 5+ compiler for Linux because it doesn&rsquo;t support <code>4.7.1</code>. In theory you could manually rewrite the <code>.csproj</code> files, because .NET 5 is compatible with .NET Standard, but Unity will overwrite your <code>.csproj</code> files without notice. That leaves you with the only option of installing the old <a href=https://www.mono-project.com/>Mono .NET Framework</a> which, unfortunately, is a dying project. I am using Debian 11 and there is no repository from Mono to install the latest version although Debian 11 has been around since August 2021&mldr; Fortunately the version of Mono for Debian 10 still works (note that you need to <a href=https://wiki.debian.org/AptConfiguration>pin the repository</a> in APT or else APT will install an older version of Mono from the Debian &ldquo;stable&rdquo; repository).</p><p>Even if you get auto-completion to work, you will have to use the UNofficial <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Unity.unity-debug">Debugger for Unity</a> extension which I had no luck running at all. It would have been nice to find out before I spent hours installing Mono&mldr;</p><p>At this point we are left with only one option.</p><h1 id=jetbrains-rider>JetBrains Rider</h1><p>Rider is not free at all, but if you are a student you can get the Educational version for free.</p><p>I tried to install Rider both manually (extracting the <code>.tar.gz</code> to <code>/opt</code>) and through <a href=https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.jetbrains.Rider>Flatpak</a>. However both attempts did not get recognized by Unity so I could not get Unity to launch Rider correctly from inside the game editor.</p><p>The only way that worked was by installing Rider with the <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/>JetBrains Toolbox App</a>. Afterwards, Rider just worked. Both auto-completion and debugging. And I did not even need to install Mono! The official .NET distribution from Microsoft worked just fine.</p><p>Finally I got a working Unity development environment!</p></section></article></main><footer><p><a href=mailto:contact@aradaelli.com>Email</a> - <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-radaelli/>LinkedIn</a> - <a href=https://github.com/skilion>GitHub</a></p></footer></body></html>
