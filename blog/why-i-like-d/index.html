According to the <a href=https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/>Tiobe Index</a>, which measures programming languages popularity, D doesn&rsquo;t make the first 20th languages, as of today. Its peak was in 2009 when it reached the <a href=https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/d/>12th position</a>.</p><p>I discovered D in 2013. I can&rsquo;t remember if it was from <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?q=dlang">Hacker News</a> or some random Google search. At the time I was looking for a new language to replace C/C++ because I had enough of the amount of obscure behaviors, crazy complicated template system, and long compilation times. When writing C++ I have limit myself to use a subset of the features of the language to avoid &ldquo;shooting myself in the foot&rdquo;. I wanted to switch to a more productive language where I could focus on writing code.</p><p>My requirements for a new language were: compiled, strongly typed, easy to learn and use (think Python), and binary compatible with existing C libraries such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL>OpenGL</a> and the various operating system libraries.</p><p>My candidates at the time were <a href=https://dlang.org/>D</a>, <a href=https://go.dev/>Go</a>, and <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org/>Rust</a>. They are all compiled languages, however Go did not have generic types at the time so I excluded it immediately. Being already familiar in C, D won over Rust easily, because the syntax of Rust is quite far from C compared to D. My only pet peeve against D was that it came with a built-in garbage collector and I was against it for performance reasons, but the GC can be disabled programmatically so I concluded that it was worth taking D for a test drive.</p><p>Later in 2016, I registered for <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage>Microsoft Onedrive</a> to make use of a promotion and, being a Linux user, found the landscape lacking of a good client to sync my files. The best option was a client written in Python which I didn&rsquo;t quite like so I decided to write <a href=https://github.com/skilion/onedrive>my own client</a> and to use D to become more familiar with the language.</p><p>In hindsight, that was a great choice. The need to write a good program for myself made me focus in learning D. I picked up <a href=https://erdani.com/tdpl/>one of the best books</a> about it, written by Andrei Alexandrescu, and dived in. The book was great and it made me completely fall in love with the language.</p><p>Here are the reasons.</p><h2 id=better-c>Better C</h2><p><strong>D</strong> main &ldquo;reason d&rsquo;etre&rdquo; is removing the limitations that C and C++ have accumulated over the years, while keeping compatibility with their binary interface and similar syntax.</p><p>If you already know C/C++ that&rsquo;s a great thing. Remove the pre-processor, the template system, the architecture dependent differences (ex. the size of an <code>int</code>), the cruft of legacy features that accumulated over the years (ex. different flavors of the standard library). Then start adding modern features like foreach, modules, <a href=https://tour.dlang.org/tour/en/basics/delegates>delegates</a>, dynamic and associative arrays (aka dictionaries or maps). The resulting syntax is so similar to C/C++ that you can will pick it up in a day. Just try out the interactive <a href=https://tour.dlang.org/>Dlang Tour</a> if you don&rsquo;t believe me.</p><p>A nice perk of the similar syntax when you are converting your code: you can assume that any expression that you wrote in C/C++ will lead the same result in D or it won&rsquo;t compile (ex. because you may need an explicit cast).</p><p>D strives to keep binary compatibility with C and C++ programs. That is excellent if you want to start porting your codebase or simply have to interface with legacy libraries. Furthermore you can directly link static libraries compiled in C within your D executable&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;as long as you translate the header files for the library.</p><h2 id=consistency>Consistency</h2><p>D has been designed from the ground up by a small number of very experienced people, namely <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Bright>Walter Bright</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Alexandrescu>Andrei Alexandrescu</a>. Their unified vision is reflected both in the syntax and the standard library of the language.</p><p>The standard library is rich of features. It provides both basic things like containers, date handling, math functions and more advanced things such as concurrency, regexes, and cryptography. You even get interfaces to common libraries like <a href=https://sqlite.org/>SQLite</a> and <a href=https://curl.se/>Curl</a>.</p><p>The standard library is built from the ground up making extensive use of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming>generic types</a> and <a href=https://tour.dlang.org/tour/en/basics/ranges>ranges</a> (equivalent of C++ or Python <em>iterators</em>). A great example is <a href=https://dlang.org/phobos/std_algorithm.html>std.algorithm</a>. All common operations like iteration, sorting, search, and comparison work on any existing or custom type that you will create (assuming you implement the expected interface for a range).</p><p>Another thing I like are the syntax choices that make the language simple and predictable. For example you cannot have multiple inheritance of classes (only of interfaces) so you cannot fall into the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem>diamond problem</a> like in C++ or Java. Furthermore all that in C++ is achieved with the pre-processor and template metaprogramming can be achieved with the same syntax that you use for writing runtime code. More on this later.</p><h2 id=built-in-dynamic-and-associative-arrays>Built-in dynamic and associative arrays</h2><p>I like to define D as a wonderful marriage between C and Python. You have the advantages of compiled code with the powerful features of Python.</p><p>In my experience, when coding, I will use dynamic and associative arrays (aka maps or dictionaries) 80% of the time. Having them built in the language is a incredible productivity boost as you don&rsquo;t have to import some library or build your own. Furthermore you have dedicated syntax that make using them much less verbose than it would as if they were and external library.</p><p>Some examples:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-d data-lang=d><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=c1>// Create a dynamic array of 10 ints, initialized to 0

I blame this as the main reason for D not being more widely adopted today.</p><p>However nowadays there are:</p><ul><li>3 compilers: the official reference compiler DMD, <a href=https://wiki.dlang.org/GDC>GCC</a>, and <a href=https://wiki.dlang.org/LDC>LLVM</a> which cover any architecture which you may want to develop for.</li><li>Autocompletion and debugging for all <a href=https://wiki.dlang.org/Editors>major IDEs</a>: Visual Studio, VS Code, Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text.</li></ul><h2 id=package-manager>Package Manager</h2><p>In line with modern programming languages such as Python, Node Js and C#, D has it&rsquo;s own official package manger, called <a href=https://code.dlang.org/>DUB</a>.</p><p>To be honest here, the package ecosystem is not nearly as developed as Python or Node Js. But this is to be expected given the lower adoption that D has. Nevertheless you have the most common use cases covered such as web development, protocols such as gRPC or REST, parsers, interfaces with commonly used libraries like SDL, OpenGL, Linux and Windows system libraries.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully this post has gave you a bit of curiosity to learn about D yourself. If that&rsquo;s the case I suggest you to spend 30 minutes on this <a href=https://tour.dlang.org/>interactive tutorial</a> which will teach you the 80% of the language feature and practice them from your browser.</p><p>&ldquo;Ok, that&rsquo;s nice&mldr;&rdquo;, you may say, &ldquo;&mldr;but what about real work, can I get paid to learn and write in D?&rdquo;. Well sort of. There are a very few places in the world that hire people to write in D, but they are niches which you will love and they will love you back if you have the hacker mentality which has pushed you to learn this elegant programming language. You can find them on Google ;)</p><hr><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29863557">Comments</a></p></section></article></main><footer><p><a href=mailto:contact@aradaelli.com>Email</a> - <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-radaelli/>LinkedIn</a> - <a href=https://github.com/skilion>GitHub</a></p></footer></body></html>
