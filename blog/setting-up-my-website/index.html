So I am now forced to take rest and I have decided to build my personal website to host my portfolio and blog.</p><p>In the past I would have built everything from scratch, which is fantastic to learn a lot. However it is quite stupid to waste 80% of my time reinventing the wheel and 20% writing actual content. So I have decided to give a go to <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> a static website generator. So far I am quite impressed. It hits the sweet spot for me in terms of automation and flexibility. No doubt it is so popular.</p><p>Using a pre-made template is a breeze, however I want to customize it fully so I am writing my own theme from scratch.</p></div></article></main><footer></footer></body></html>
