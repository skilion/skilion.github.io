title: "About Me"
---

As a child, I've always loved taking apart toys to understand their inner mechanics.

When my first computer arrived, I was excited to apply the same curiosity. However, I soon realized that it was much more complex than I had anticipated. So, I started a lifelong journey to learn more.

Computers have changed a lot since then, but I never lost the appetite to learn. Technology keeps evolving, new things come out every year, there is no chance to get bored of it.
