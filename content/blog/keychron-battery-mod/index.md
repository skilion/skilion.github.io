In the last year or so I became very fond of 75% keyboards. I love the compact design that retains all the function keys which are so useful in the day-to-day of a programmer.

For Christmas, I finally decided to scratch my itch and buy a beautiful optical Keychron K3 off eBay. It's been a joy to type on, but with a big downside... the battery life is quite bad.

With backlighting off, I managed roughly three days between charges. Online reviews for new units rarely claim more than a week. I didn't want the keyboard wired constantly, so I decided to remove the dust from my solder and put my "collection" of old phone batteries to good use.
